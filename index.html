		<h1>BARCELONA</h1>
		<h2>While historic and culturally protected buildings typically consist of European castles and churches, it’s easy to forget how far back the United States really goes. There may be a lot of modern skyscrapers and neighborhoods in America, but take a look at one of the oldest pillars of society — the schoolhouse — and you’ll see just how much history we have.
		Curious to know which high schools rank among the oldest in the country? We’ve rounded up the oldest high school in every state  — one of which dates back nearly 400 years and another that served as a hospital for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. From Alabama to Wyoming, you won’t find more storied educational institutions than these.</h2>
